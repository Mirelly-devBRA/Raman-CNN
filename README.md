# Raman-CNN
Raman Spectra Classification using CNN using TensorFlow and Keras. This project was done as part of work done for ISI in the summer of 2021. 

The model is based on the work done by [Jinchao et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09022.pdf) and uses the model as outlined on that paper. 

The model was trained on a small dataset of 9 classes with 243 different spectra in total. No data augmentation was done. Below you can see the structure of the recreated CNN. ![alt text](https://github.com/DavidAlvesRodrigues/Raman-CNN/blob/main/model_plot.png).
